## üìù Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Missing API Keys**: Google Maps, Firebase configuration
2. **Incorrect Bundle ID**: Must match App Store Connect
3. **Missing Permissions**: Users will get crashes if permissions not declared
4. **Large App Size**: Optimize assets and remove unused dependencies
5. **Background Location**: Requires special justification for App Store review
6. **Third-party Libraries**: Ensure all are App Store compliant

## üö® Critical for Taxi App

Since this is a taxi booking app, pay special attention to:
- Location permissions and background location usage
- Push notification setup for ride updates
- Payment processing compliance
- Driver verification and safety features
- Real-time location tracking justification
